# Knave
This is a system for Foundry Virtual Tabletop (https://foundryvtt.com/) that emulates Ben Milton's fabulous classless old-school RPG Knave.

It features an automatic character generator, an assortment of well known AD&D Monsters and a full set of icons for the games tools and gear.

## Automatic Character Generator
Quickly and easily generate new characters on the fly at the click of a button.
